#Airbnb Deal Classification Project

##Overview

This project aims to classify Airbnb listings in New York City as Good, Neutral, or Bad Deals using a combination of Exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, decision tree modeling, and a rule-based logic system. Additionally, a Shiny dashboard is provided for real-time deal prediction and visual exploration.

##Project Structure

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Script: [`Exploratory_Data_Analysis.R`]

Key insights were derived through visual and statistical exploration of:
- Numerical distributions (price, footage, reviews, etc.)
- Boxplots stratified by deal category
- Correlation matrix of engineered features
- Borough-level summaries
- Scatter plots of price vs. features colored by deal

Tools used: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`

---

##Model Building and Prediction Pipeline

Script: [`PredictionModel3(Final Version).R`]

###Steps:
1. Feature Engineering
   - Raw metrics (e.g., `price_per_foot`, `log_price`)
   - Relative metrics (vs. borough averages)
   - Categorical binning (`price_category`, `review_category`, etc.)

2. Model Development
   - tree1: Based on numeric and engineered continuous variables
   - tree2: Based on categorized/binned features
   - Rule-based classifier: Custom logic for deal classification
   - combined_tree: Final ensemble decision tree

3. Cross-Validation
   - Two-fold validation with accuracy reporting

4. Final Prediction
   - Trained models applied to test data
   - Results saved to `submission_airbnb.csv`

##Shiny Dashboard

Script: [`app.R`]

###Features:
- Enter listing attributes to predict deal type
- Display top 3 most similar listings
- Interactive scatter plot (Review vs. Footage) colored by predicted deal

To run locally:

shiny::runApp("app.R")


##Outputs
-submission_airbnb.csv: Final classification predictions

-.rds files: Serialized models, borough averages, and quantiles

-price_vs_review.png: Visual output from EDA
